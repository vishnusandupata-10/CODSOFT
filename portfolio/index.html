                <h3>Seller's Express:</h3>
                <p>Sellers Xpress is a website which establishes a direct connection between the end user and local vendors. Local vendors get an opportunity to sell their products to a 
                    larger circle. At times when they are left back with a lot a of stock at the end of the day they simply throw it away on the roads even though they are in good condition 
                    because the amount they earn will be spent if they arrange to transport them back and store them.

                <h3>Student Stay Using Data Science</h3>
                <p>This project focuses on the development of a machine learning based system for  Student stay to facilitate the search for suitable accommodations for incoming students in  new city.
                    Finding the ideal place to live can be a daunting task, especially for students with diverse preferences regarding budget, amenities, and proximity to educational institutions. 
                    This project addresses this challenge by implementing a data-driven solution.   The process begins with the collection and preprocessing of data related to various accommodations available in the city.
                     Features such as location, rent, amenities, and distance to universities are considered. After data preparation, the K-Means Clustering algorithm is employed to categorize accommodations into distinct clusters based on their characteristics.
